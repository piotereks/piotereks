## 👋 Hi, I’m Piotr Sakowski (@PioterekS)

I’m a developer who prefers building **practical tools** over leaving ideas in notebooks.
Most of my time goes into crafting web utilities, integrating data feeds, and maintaining the small projects that quietly power things behind the scenes.

## 🧰 Tooling & Stack

* **Languages**
  `Python` for data wrangling and automation
  `JavaScript` / `React` for UI glue
  `Bash` when Linux nostalgia from the 90s kicks in—or when a CI/CD pipeline just needs to be done right

* **Frameworks & Libraries**
  `React`, `React Native`, `Vite`, `Tailwind`

* **Data & Integrations**
  `SQLite` and `Postgres` for persistence
  A pile of APIs, custom cache layers when latency matters
  Solid experience with `Oracle` as well

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find Here

My GitHub is a collection of **experiments turned into tools**—from ESP dictionary helpers to VCF generators and other utilities that started as “I need this” projects and grew legs.

## 🧠 Background & Approach

* I started with Linux boxes in the 90s, microcontrollers, and assembler—and never really stopped experimenting.
* That curiosity turned into a career stitching together **databases, backend services, hardware integrations, and frontend dashboards**.
* I’m especially drawn to systems where hardware, APIs, and UI meet—places where things can break in interesting ways and elegance actually matters.

## 🌱 Learning & Current Thoughts

* Currently learning **Android development** and heavily experimenting with **GitHub Copilot**.
* After a few months of programming with AI, I clearly see the benefits—but I’m also cautious.
  It’s powerful, intangible, and demands new mental models to use well.

> Anyone who thinks dependency hell in Python or JavaScript is harsh
> should try AI—and the *art* of prompting.
