## 👋 Hi, I’m Piotr Sakowski (@PioterekS)  

I build **practical tools**—projects that start as “I need this” and end up being useful to others.  
Mostly web utilities, system integrations, and small projects that quietly do real work.  

> **✨ Linux Rules the World ✨**  
> *My personal credo. Since always.*

## 🧰 Stack  

* **Python** — automation, data wrangling  
* **JavaScript / React** — UI glue  
* **Bash** — CI/CD and Linux things  
* **React, React Native, Vite, Tailwind**  
* **SQLite, Postgres**, strong **Oracle** background  

---

## 🧠 Background  

Started with Linux boxes, microcontrollers, and assembler in the 90s.  
Now I enjoy stitching together **APIs, databases, hardware, and UIs** into systems that actually hold up.

## 🌱 Now  

* Learning **Android**  
* Using **GitHub Copilot** daily  
* AI helps—but only if you learn how to *drive* it

> _should try AI — the so-called ☢︎ art of prompting ☣︎_
